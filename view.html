Critical New Zealand Detail:
On Page 2 of the preview, I have included a clause stating that the one-way flight cost is not recoverable. This is a vital "Migrant Worker Protection" rule in New Zealand. If an employer tries to "bond" a worker to the cost of their recruitment or travel, they can lose their Accredited Employer status.

Would you like me to add a "Company Stamp" or "Digital Watermark" feature to the final page for extra security?
